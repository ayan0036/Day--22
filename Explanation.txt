 What is Property Binding in Angular? 
Property binding in Angular is a technique that allows you to pass data from a component (TypeScript class) to the HTML template. It is used to display dynamic values on the UI. The value of a property in the component is bound to an element property in the DOM. 

This helps keep the view updated automatically whenever the componentâ€™s property changes. 

What is Event Binding in Angular? 
Event binding is a way to handle user interactions in Angular applications. It allows you to listen to events like clicks, input changes, or key presses and call corresponding methods in the component. 

It creates a connection between the template and the logic, enabling dynamic and interactive behavior in the application.
